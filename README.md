# lolirift

You play a lolicon in a world full of lolis, but there is a problem: there are other lolicons too! To have all lolis on your side your goal is to defeat the other lolicons. How you do it is up to you.

## Gameplay

The whole scenario is playing on a grid based world. What currently is in is:
- Building structures
- Training lolis
- Moving lolis

Also the world is not completely 2 dimensional. Every field has height informations, which are affecting the movement. For instance, when you are standing on a field with an lower height than the field you want to go to, you will need longer. A similar case occurs when you are doing the opposite: staying on a higher field and moving to a lower field. Your movement then will be increased.

If you have some suggestions on other mechanics you want to see in the game, feel free to post an issue about it.
